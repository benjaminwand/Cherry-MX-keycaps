The ones in the folder ‘with LED’ are 2mm higher so it works if you stick a 3mm LED into the Cherry MX. If you use switches with built-in LED, the ‘without LED’-one might work though.

Please start by writing the desired measures into the spreadsheet of each FreeCAD-file. 

These keycaps are designed to go around the switches, if you choose a number smaller than sidelength-of-the-switches-plus-3mm, it won’t work.
